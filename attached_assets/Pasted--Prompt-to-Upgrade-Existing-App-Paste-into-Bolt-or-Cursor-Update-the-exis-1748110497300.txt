### 🛠️ Prompt to Upgrade Existing App (Paste into Bolt or Cursor)

> ✅ Update the existing app with the following changes and improvements:
>
> 1. **Replace the existing ChatGPT API key** with this new **DeepSeek API key**:
>
>    ```
>    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
>    ```
>
>    * Ensure it's loaded securely from `.env` using `process.env.DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`.
>    * Update all API calls accordingly to use DeepSeek’s structure.
> 2. **Add a database** to store generated results, user sessions, and saved landing pages.
>
>    * Use **PostgreSQL** with **Prisma ORM**.
>    * Add a model for `User`, `GeneratedPage`, and optionally `PromptTemplate`.
>    * Save each generation into the database with timestamp and user info.
> 3. **Enhance the UI/UX** to look even more polished and modern:
>
>    * Improve spacing, typography, and layout with Tailwind classes (`gap-6`, `pt-12`, `rounded-3xl`).
>    * Add subtle shadows and depth (`shadow-xl`, `hover:scale-105`).
>    * Use **Framer Motion** for input transitions, button animations, and output reveals.
>    * Add **microinteractions**: hover effects on feature blocks and export buttons.
>    * Update buttons and form fields with a cleaner, more modern style.
>    * Add hover tooltips for actions like “Copy JSON” or “Download HTML”.
>    * Implement a floating FAB (button) for export actions on mobile and desktop.
> 4. **Complete all pages with detailed content**:
>
>    * `/about`: Add mission, vision, and what BrandForge does.
>    * `/pricing`: Include a free vs pro plan comparison with example use cases.
>    * `/terms`, `/privacy`: Add markdown-based legal templates.
>    * `/dashboard`: Display a table/grid of previously generated pages with:
>
>      * Title, date, export options, delete button.
>    * `/auth/login` and `/auth/register`: Use clean, styled input forms.
> 5. Add **extra features**:
>
>    * Emoji + brand tone suggestion in generation result.
>    * Add prompt templates for common business types (SaaS, Creator, Tool, etc.)
>    * Store the last 5 generations in localStorage for quick access if not logged in.
>    * Optional: Add a shareable public page for each generation.
>
> ⚠️ Make sure the app is still fully responsive and deployable to Vercel or Render.
>
> 📁 Update `.env.example` and `README.md` to reflect new API and database setup.
